# Homework 3
## Prerequisites
Python 3 required.
Additional python pakages have to be installed based on the requirements.  
**Note: Tensorflow only supports up to python3.6 so far.**  

## Run the code
**Note: Because the weights are initialized randomly, the validation accuracy may vary repectively.**

To run the Tensorflow code:
```
python3 tensor_NN.py
```
To run the Numpy code:
```
python3 NN_relu_numpy.py
```
